# Logisim_CPU
Made a CPU in Logisim when I was 14 (2009), and wrote a naive assembler and compiler for it in Flash.

The CPU's design is inspired by Donn Stewart, http://cpuville.com.

## Compiler

The **DrewCode** compiler, written in Flash, can also compile to a Windows binary, which is actually an emulator for the CPU compiled for Windows. You can access it at http://compiler.drewgottlieb.net.
